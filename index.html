                  The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom) is a breed of dog of the
                  Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in
                  north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe.
                  Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the
                  Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs,
                  specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the
                  Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German
                  Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the
                  Zwergspitz ("Dwarf-Spitz").
                  <br /><br />
                  The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners
                  since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly
                  small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became
                  universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone,
                  the size of the breed decreased by half. Overall, the
                  Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health
                  issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More
                  rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition
                  colloquially known as "black skin disease". This is a genetic
                  disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all
                  or most of its hair.[2] As of 2013, in terms of registration
                  figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the
                  top fifty most popular breeds in the US, and the current
                  fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity
                  worldwide. <br /><br />
